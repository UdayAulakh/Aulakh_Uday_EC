        Hey, I’m Uday! I’m a student at UT Austin studying MIS, but outside of classes
        you’ll usually catch me shooting hoops, working on my golf swing, or hanging out
        with friends. I love cheering for the Lakers, Longhorns, 49ers, and Giants, and
        I’m always down to try a new Austin food spot (favorites so far: Ember Kitchen,
        Odd Duck, and Terry Black’s BBQ 🔥).
